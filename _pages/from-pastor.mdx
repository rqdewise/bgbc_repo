As Pastor of Bordergate Baptist Church, I invite you to visit any of our services. You will be able to participate in singing some of the wonderful old Hymns that have blessed the hearts of Christians for many years. You will hear Bible based preaching from the old King James Version of the Bible. Each service makes the wonderful, life-giving truths of the Bible practical and relevant to your life.

Our world faces so many conflicts, so little peace and joy, so little understanding as to the purpose of life. We believe the Bible has answers that will help you find peace, hope encouragement and comfort. Yes, all of these is in the message and wonderful promises of God’s eternal Word.

Children are an important part of our church family. We purpose to teach them the truths of God’s Word. A Bible-centered education is a rich heritage that we are passing on to them.

Jesus said in **Matthew 11:28, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”** We echo God’s gracious invitation to you!

### May we share with you some Good News ###

### about the Gospel of Jesus Christ? ###

## But first, the Bad News… ##

**“…by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:” Romans 5:12**

**“For the wages of sin is death…” Romans 6:23**

**“I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.” Luke 13:3**

These Scriptures show the bad news about the evil results and consequences of our sins. Every soul is consigned to an eternal, everlasting place of torment. If the Bible’s message stopped here the news would certainly not be good.

## **Now for the Good News!** ##

I want to tell you the most wonderful news this world has ever been given. The Bible term for “Good News” is the word “gospel.” In **1 Corinthians 15:3-4**, we find the gospel defined:

How is His death “Good News”? He died for us!

**“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we are yet sinners, Christ died for us.” Romans 5:8**

**“For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God.” 1 Peter 3:18**

Jesus Christ, the sinless Son of God, became our sin and bore our penalty that we might be forgiven!

**“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.” 2 Corinthians 5:21**

If you took all the good things that ever came your way in this life and were able to stack them in a neat little pile, what would these be in view of eternity? You cannot take even one of these good things with you beyond the grave. Apart from the new birth found in Christ, there is no Good News. Without this new birth you are consigned to the lake of burning fire to suffer forever.

My friend, Jesus died for your sins and arose from the grave so that you could be saved. Do you want to be saved? God’s plan of Salvation is simple.

## YOU MUST RECOGNIZE YOUR SINS AND THEIR PENALTY ##

To receive the benefits of the Gospel you first acknowledge that you have a need. As a sinner, you need the new birth.

**“…There is none righteous, no not one…For there is no difference…For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” Romans 3:10, 22, 23**

**“And it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.“ Hebrews 9:27**

## YOU MUST REALIZE YOU HAVE NO HOPE OUTSIDE OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST ##

For God says, **“…All our righteousness are as filthy rags…” Isaiah 64:6**

No other person or thing can save. **“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.” Acts 4:12**

**“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Romans 6:23**

To escape the penalty for sin, you must believe that only His sacrifice pays for your sins.

**“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” John 3:16**

## YOU MUST REPENT ##

The word of God commands us to ***repent.***

**“Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.” Acts 3:19**

To repent means to be willing to ***turn from your sins*** and ***turn to the Lord***, simply trusting His promises in His Word and for His forgiving mercy. If you are convinced of your sin and desire to turn from it to the Lord, then you are ready to act on the Good News!


## WILL YOU COME TO HIM NOW? ##

Jesus said, **“…repent ye, and believe the gospel.” Mark 1:15**

If you are honestly willing to repent, just turn your heart to God in prayer. He alone is able to save you. Won’t you call out to the God of Heaven now as the following verses invite you to do?

**“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” Romans 10:9-10**

**“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Romans 10:13**

When you repent, the sins of the past will lose their glamour. Instead, there will be a desire for a new life which honours and pleases the Saviour.

My friend, won’t you trust what God has said in His Word? I hope you will.

Please contact us if we can help you further understand God’s wonderful Word. We would be happy to answer your questions! We have prepared a private Bible Study workbook for you, which explain the truths presented above in fuller detail. We would gladly give this to you upon request.
