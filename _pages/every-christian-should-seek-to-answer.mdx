## Every Christian Should Seek The Answer To This Question . . .
### "Lord, What Wilt Thou Have Me To Do?" Acts 9:6
#### Your Life Truly Begins Anew 

You have trusted Jesus Christ and you have received ETERNAL LIFE
Now, you are ready to start living a life that PLEASES GOD.
You want to be a successful Christian.

My Name____________________________
I was Saved (Month/Day/Year)___________________

"This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you." Exodus 12:2

### HERE IS HOW YOUR LIFE BEGAN

1. **You Were Born-Again, Hence You Became:**
* A babe in Christ. I Peter 2:2
* And a Son of God. John 1:12 and John 3:3, 5, 7
2. **This Salvation Came Not:**
* By your own goodness or morality.
* By your keeping the Ten Commandments.
* By your observance of the "Golden Rule."
* By your participation in the "Lord's Supper."

3. **This Salvation Was:**
* A Gift of God.
"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." Ephesians 2:8, 9
* By Faith.
"So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God." Romans 10:17

* By Believing with the Heart.
"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in shine heart that God bath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." Romans 10:9, 10

4. **This Salvation Is:**
* Eternal.
"And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand." John 10:28
You can never lose it. (Read Romans 8:35-39)
You can, however, lose the JOY of it. "Restore unto me the JOY of thy salvation;" Psalms 51:12
You need to know how to get the most out of your Christian Life. "I am come that they might have LIFE, and that they might have it more ABUNDANTLY." John 10:10

### STEPS TO A HAPPY CHRISTIAN LIFE
1. **PUBLIC CONFESSION of your faith in Christ as Saviour.**
This means that as quickly as possible Her salvation, you should take your stand publicly in a regular church service declaring that you have been saved.
a. This is usually done during the "invitation hymn" that is sung at the close of each service.
b. This is done in obedience to what Jesus said:
"Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven." Matthew 10:32
"...whosoever believeth on him, shall not be ashamed." Romans 10:11

c. This will not only help you and bless your life, but it will be a testimony to others who need to do the same thing, and will influence those about you.
2.** BAPTISM . . . .which is immersion in water of one who has already been saved.**
a. Baptism is a picture of Christ's death, burial and resurrection.
b. Baptism is an outward picture to the world of what has taken place in your own heart and life.
1. * Death to Sin.
2. * Burial of the Old Life.
3. * Resurrection to walk in newness of life.

c. Baptism is the answer of a Good Conscience toward God.
"The like figure whereunto even baptism cloth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), by the resurrection of Jesus Christ." Peter 3:21
Though Baptism does not save you, nor help save you, nor keep you saved, it is a vital link in a happy Christian life.
**Scriptural Baptism requires:** 
1. A Saved Candidate. 
2. The right method-- immersion. 
3. The right motive. 
4. The right authority.
<br />
3. **REGULAR ATTENDANCE at all services of the Church.**
"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching." Hebrews 10:25
a. It is here that your soul is fed.
b. It is here you are surrounded by fellow Christians who can and will help you.
c. It is here you are constantly reminded of what Christ has done for you, and your heart is kept warm and grateful.
d. It is here you will be able to serve Him who loved you and died for your sins, for the Church is His body, and He works in and through His body of which He is the Head.
4. **PRAYER LIFE**
This means to talk with Him anytime and anywhere.
"Pray without ceasing. " I Thess. 5:17
a. Prayer is the "sincere desire of the heart."
b. Begin every day with Prayer.
<SpanItalic>"Whisper a prayer in the morning,
Whisper a prayer at noon,
Whisper a prayer in the evening,
To keep your heart in tune."</SpanItalic>

c. The gate of Prayer is NEVER SHUT. Start now to form the habit of a daily quiet time.
Decide on a time, preferably in the morning.
Decide on a place, where you will be alone and uninterrupted.
d. To Pray is the greatest thing you can do; and to do it well there must be CALMNESS, TIME and DELIBERATION.
"If you are too busy to Pray, you are too busy!"
e. Anything that is big enough to concern you, is not too small a matter for which to pray.
f. To live without prayer, is to live without His power. 
5. **DAILY BIBLE READING**
The Bible is God's personal letter to YOU. His WORD is a "Light unto our feet." Psalms 119 :105
a. When you read the Bible...... Remember that God is speaking to you. Believe what God says. Do what God commands.
b. Read slowly "tasting the words."
c. Underline passages that impress you. Note passages you need to have explained.
d. Memorize one verse every day.
e. Meditate daily upon what you read, recalling it many times during the day.
f. Every chapter in the Bible is a finger of God pointing out the way of life and the path of duty.

<SpanItalic>"Blessed Bible, sacred treasure,
Precious Book of all the best
There is Comfort, never failing
And a calm abiding rest."
"Read with reverence, and commit it,
Verse by verse, and day by day.
It's the Word that God has spoken
And it shall not pass away."</SpanItalic>

g. Reading the Bible will be one of your most interesting experiences. 

#### START BY READING:

1. The Gospel of John.
2. I John (to gain assurance).
3. James (to teach us how to live before men)
4. Psalms (Devotional reading)

6. **CONSECRATE YOUR ALL.**
<SpanItalic>"My life, O Lord, I give to thee,
My talents, time, and all;
I'll serve Thee, Lord, and faithful be,
I'll hear thy faintest call."</SpanItalic>

a. **Give your TITHE** (10 per cent of your increase) through your local church to the Lord.
"The tithe is the Lords" "Bring ye all the tithes . . ." Malachi 3:10
Jesus put his approval upon tithing, "....these ought ye to have done . . ." Matthew 23:23
That which began before the Law, was incorporated into the Law, is still God's will for every Christian. (See Hebrews 7)

Every Scripture that commands or invites us to give, promises us greater material prosperity.

<SpanItalic>"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again." Luke 6:38</SpanItalic>

<br />**You cannot out give God.**
\
\
Every Christian that tithes is a living testimony to that truth. God's challenge is ".....prove me now herewith....." Malachi 3:10
\
\
b. **Give Your TIME to the Lord. Sunday is the Lord's Day.**
\
\
It is a Day of **Worship.**
\
It is a Day of Commemoration of the **resurrection of Jesus Christ**.
\
It is the **"First Day"** of the week, and we should give God "First" things and the best things.
\
\
c. **Give All Your TALENTS to the Lord.**
\
\
God can take what you have, magnify, and multiply it, and use if for His Glory.
\
He used the 5 loaves and 2 fishes the little boy was willing to give.
\
He used David's sling to slay the giant.
\
God will require an accounting for your talents. Let us be sure to use and not hide our talents.
\
\
<SpanItalic>"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." Romans 12:1</SpanItalic>
<br />
<SpanItalic>"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's." I Cor. 6:19, 20 </SpanItalic>

<br />d. **Strive to live a CHRIST CENTERED LIFE.**
\
\
Let your MIND be one through which Christ thinks.
\
Let your HEART be one through which Christ loves.
\
Let your VOICE be one through which Christ speaks. 
\
Let your HAND be one through which Christ helps. 
\
Let your FEET be those through which Christ walks.
\
Let your EARS hear for Christ.
\
Let your EYES see for Christ.
\
Strive to be more patient, kind, loving, joyous, and unselfish day by day.
\
EACH NIGHT survey the day's activities. Profit tomorrow by today's failures
\
\
*IN A QUESTIONABLE SITUATION ask yourself:*
\
"What would Christ do?"
\
"What does the Bible teach?"
\
"What does the Holy Spirit say?"<br />

#### Never do that which you know the Bible forbids.

Remember in all things God said, "....my grace is sufficient for thee. " II Corinthians 12:9
\
\
e. **Be a SOUL - WINNER.**
\
\
He Saved you, He can Save Others. Any Christian CAN win souls. Every Christian SHOULD win souls. Do not wait for people to come to you
\
\
"Go ye therefore . . . " Matthew 28:18 "... and ye shall be witnesses unto me..." Acts 1:8
\
\
Start NOW by telling your family and friends that you are a Christian. Give your Personal Testimony as Paul gave his on numerous occasions.<br />

<SpanItalic>"Give me a faithful heart. . .
Like to Thee,
That each departing day
Henceforth may see
Some work of love begun
Some deed of kindness done,
Some wand'rer sought and won,
Something for Thee."</SpanItalic>
<br />
<br />Make this the motto of your life: 
<br />
<SpanItalic>"Only one life 'twill soon be past;
Only what's done for Christ will last."</SpanItalic>
<br />
<br />"I expect to pass through this world but once; Any good thing, therefore, that I can do, Or any kindness that I can show to a human being, Or a word that I can speak for Jesus, Let me do it NOW: let me not neglect nor defer it. For I shall not pass this way again."<br />

#### REMEMBER

1. Other Christians are praying for you, and we have confidence that you will be a great Christian and a faithful soul winner for Jesus.

2. If you do yield to temptation and do that which is not right, turn to: I John 1:9 "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. "

3. Your Pastor is willing, ready, and able to help you with your spiritual problems, large or small. Go to him; confide in him. He will give you Bible answers. He will join in prayer with you. He will encourage you in your service for Christ.
<br />
#### ABOVE ALL BE TRUE TO GOD AT ANY AND EVERY COST
<br />
"Be thou faithful unto death and he will give thee a crown of life. " Revelation 2:10

### CHURCH COVENANT

"Having been led, as we believe, by the Spirit of God, to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as our Saviour, and on the profession of our faith, having been baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, we do now in the presence of God, angels, and this assembly, most solemnly and joyfully enter into covenant with one another, as one body in Christ.
\
\
"We engage therefore, by the aid of the Holy Spirit, to walk together in Christian love; to strive for the advancement of this church in knowledge, holiness, and comfort; to promote its prosperity and spirituality, to sustain its worship, ordinances, discipline, and doctrines; to contribute cheerfully and regularly to the support of the ministry, the expenses of the church, the relief of the poor, and the spread of the gospel through all nations.
\
\
"We also engage to maintain family and secret devotion; to religiously educate our children; to seek the salvation of our kindred and acquaintances; to walk circumspectly in the world; to be just in our dealings, faithful in our engagements, and exemplary in our deportment; to avoid all tattling, backbiting, and excessive anger. To abstain from the sale and use of intoxicating drinks as a beverage, and to be zealous in our efforts to advance the kingdom of our Saviour.
\
\
"We further engage to watch over one another in brotherly love; to remember each other in prayer, to aid each other in sickness and distress; to cultivate Christian sympathy in feeling and courtesy in speech; to be slow to take offense, but always ready for reconciliation, and mindful of the rules of our Saviour to secure it without delay.
\
\
"We moreover engage that when we remove from this place, we will as soon as possible unite with some other church, where we can carry out the spirit of this covenant and the principles of God's Word."

### A CONDENSED STATEMENT OF OUR CONFESSION OF FAITH

1. We believe the whole Bible from Genesis 1:1 to Revelation 22:21, as the verbally inspired and infallible Word of God.
2. We believe Jesus Christ was born of Mary the Virgin, and is the Son of God, and God the Son.
3. We believe that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, the Just for the unjust that He might bring us to God.
4. We believe that He arose from the grave the third day according to the scriptures.
5. We believe that He, only, is the great High Priest, and we need not the intercession of any man, but that Christ ever liveth to make intercession for us.
6. We believe that Christ will come again in Person bodily, visibly, to establish His Kingdom on the earth.
7. We believe that in order to be saved, the soul must be born again — “Ye must be born again.”
8. We believe that every truly born again soul should declare his faith by the act of baptism, (immersion in water) setting forth the Lord’s death, burial, and resurrection.
9. We believe that the church is a body of baptized believers whose only mission is, not to “reform the world,” but to preach and teach the Word of God to the individual soul
\
\
We invite all New Testament Baptist Churches to enjoy this fellowship with us on the ground of the Scriptures as briefly outlined in these statements of faith.
\
\
To sum it all up, we believe in a supernatural Bible, which tells of a supernatural Christ, Who had a supernatural birth, Who spoke supernatural words, Who performed supernatural miracles, Who lived a supernatural life, Who died a supernatural death, who rose in supernatural power, Who ascended in supernatural splendour, Who intercedes as a supernatural priest and Who will one day return in supernatural glory to establish a supernatural kingdom on the earth.
