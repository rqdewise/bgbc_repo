### FAQs

The thought of visiting a church for the first time can be intimidating. All of us were visitors at one point so we know that it’s much easier to enter a new place when you know what to expect. At Bordergate, you will find a warm and friendly atmosphere, uplifting music, and helpful Bible teaching and preaching. We hope you will find the following helpful information:\
\
**Where do I park?**
\
\
Our church does not have its parking lot, so most of us park on the street or at the Basement of the Chinese Market down at San Lorenzo. There are six parking slots right outside the church building with parking meters, but most of the time, our neighbours who live in the same building as us will park their cars during the evening, and when Sunday comes, most of these six slots were not available anymore.
\
\
**Which entrance should I use?**
\
\
You may use either entrance. Most people enter through the Rua Do San Jose main entrance, which provides access to the Auditorium, restrooms, nurseries, and classrooms. Others choose the kitchen entrance Patio De Cadeira which leads to the back of the Auditorium.
\
\
**What should I wear?**
\
\
There is no dress code for our members or our guests. Our pastor and many of our church family dress in more traditional “Sunday” dress; however, our primary goal is that you would feel welcome and comfortable on your visit here at Bordergate.
\
\
**What are your services like?**
\
\
While we follow a traditional style, our services are not ultra-formal. You will enjoy a warm family atmosphere, uplifting congregational singing, and a practical biblical message from Pastor James. Hymnals and KJV Bibles are available in the pews for your use during the service.
\
\
**Will I have to stand up in front of people?**
\
\
Though our pastor does welcome our guests at every service, he will not single you out or make you feel uncomfortable. He will only ask that you raise your hand so that our leaders can give you a small gift from our church. They will also give you a Visitors Card to fill out with any information you feel comfortable giving so that we can have a record of your visit and better meet your needs.
\
\
**Do I need to give in the offering?**
\
\
No. We don’t ask you to put anything in the offering plate when it passes. We want our service to be a gift to you. We hope you will find in this place a warm family spirit, truth from God’s Word, and a place where you can grow in God’s grace. Please don’t feel any obligation to participate in the offering as a guest.
\
\
**Do you provide childcare during any of your services?**
\
\
Yes. We offer safe, clean, and professional nursery care during every service for children ages 0-3 so that you can enjoy the service without distraction. 
\
\
**Where do my children go?**
\
\
We offer age-specific classes during the Sunday School hour for children and adults. If you attend the Sunday School hour, we will be happy to take you and your family to the appropriate classes. During the Sunday Morning Service, children in K4-4th grade are welcome to attend our Junior Church service, while older children can attend the Morning Service in the Auditorium.
