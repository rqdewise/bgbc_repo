### Bordergate Baptist’s Mission ###

The mission of the people of God called Bordergate Baptist Church
is to glorify God, therefore, we strive to know Christ, build His Church
and make Him known to all people as we continue to seek His will.
We believe this mission can be fulfilled through…

### WORSHIPPING ###
**John 4:23 \
“…worship the Father in spirit and in truth…”**\
We commit ourselves to glorifying God by Worship, which is in the adoration of God; Worship is duly required of all His children through praise, prayer, the reading and preaching of His Word, and should inspire witness leading to discipleship. Every Christian may worship God privately; however, this should never replace the corporate worship of the church.

### GROWING ###
**2 Peter 3:18 \
“But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ”** 
\
We commit ourselves to glorifying God by moving toward maturity through learning, fellowshipping, and doing the work of ministry.

### CARING ###
**Galatians 6:10 \
“As we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.”**\
We commit ourselves to glorifying God by making Christ known to the world, by caring for those of the flock of God, and by demonstrating the love of God to all peoples.

### SHARING ###
**Matthew 10:7-10“…freely ye have received, freely give.”** 
We commit ourselves to glorifying God by sharing what we know,
what we have, and what we are with all peoples.

### EQUIPPING ###
**Ephesians 4:12a "For the perfecting (equipping) of the saints for the work of ministry…"** 

### Bordergate Baptist’s Vision Statement ###
In an effort to fulfill the mission of Bordergate Baptist Church for the next 5 years we will strive to bring


1. spiritual maturity to our people through Biblical preaching and teaching.
2. numerical growth by winning the lost to Christ.
3. an increase in the number of people involved in ministry through spiritual education and opportunity.
